## Some of the challenges were:

1. Drawing the stick man with canvas API
2. Things like "Displaying keyboard input on screen, and remove the rendering 0.8s later"
3. CSS Keyframes to add animations the way I want them to
4. Logic to check if the alphabet has already been entered before
5. Utilizing guard clauses in the logic above (to try to make it more readable but not sure if it does)
6. Module bundling issues with Browserify (to import random-words)

## What could be improved?

- Not the cleanest code, but figured that I'd move on and come back later after experiencing more projects.
- Better stickman drawing
- Starting animation can get redundant when the user already knows to type the letters on the keyboard.
- The app is non-responsive and does not consider playing in mobile environments.
